# CausalNetwork
Leveraged Bayesian networks to develop a sophisticated anomaly detection system. This involved detecting anomalous data points and subsequently conducting in-depth diagnostics to identify underlying factors and then predicting the correct values. Integrated causality within the network, enabling interventional and counterfactual simulations.
