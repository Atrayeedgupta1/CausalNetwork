# Inference with Bayesian Network
Problem statement 1:<br>
Given a dataset. Identify the anomalies, find the feature causing the anomalous behavior and predict the correct values for that feature. <br>
Problem statement 2:<br>
There is an existing alarm tree. Simulate the same thing in a Bayesian network and find the root cause of a problem given certain evidence in particular nodes. <br>
Problem statement 3:<br>
Create a Causal Bayesian network and make interventional and counterfactual queries to infer important insights. <br>

Why Bayesian network models?<br>
First and foremost, we needed a concrete class of models on which to demonstrate and apply our ideas. Second, we wanted to use probability theory as our foundation. Our use of probability theory comes from necessity: most AI application domains involve uncertainty, with which we need to deal with explicitly and from the start in a principled way. Finally, we are interested in deriving cause-effect relationships from data. Even though many classes of models can be used to represent uncertain domainsâ€”like decision trees, artificial neural networks etc. only in the Bayesian network literature do we find claims of being able to represent and learn directed causal relationships.<br>
They can be used for a wide range of tasks including reasoning, anomaly detection, diagnostics, causal prediction.

Preliminaries<br>
Bayesian network: <br>
A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a probability distribution over a set of variables. It consists of two parts: the directed acyclic graph and a set of probability distributions one for each node conditioned on the parent. <br>
Example of a discrete network<br>

A node can represent one variable or many variables and can be discrete, continuous and functional.<br>
Here A, B and C are the discrete variables having two states each and the arrows represent direct dependencies. 
The edges may or may not be causal. <br>
The conditional probabilities for each of the variable are given <br><br>
P(A)<br>
